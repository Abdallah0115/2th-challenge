<h1>Education</h1><hr>
<h3>Larry Page :</h3>
  <p>
    Page attended the Okemos Montessori School (now called Montessori Radmoor) in Okemos, Michigan, from ages 2 to 7 (1975 to 1979). He attended East Lansing High School<br>
    graduating in 1991. In summer school, he attended Interlochen Center for the Arts playing flute but mainly saxophone for two summers. Page holds a Bachelor of Science in<br>
    computer engineering from the University of Michigan, with honors and a Master of Science in computer science from Stanford University. While at the University of Michigan,<br>
    Page created an inkjet printer made of Lego bricks (literally a line plotter), after he thought it possible to print large posters cheaply with the use of inkjet cartridges—Page reverse-<br>
    engineered the ink cartridge, and built the electronics and mechanics to drive it. Page served as the president of the Beta Epsilon chapter of the Eta Kappa Nu fraternity, and<br>
    was a member of the 1993 "Maize & Blue" University of Michigan Solar Car team. As an undergraduate at the University of Michigan, he proposed that the school replace its bus<br>
    system with a personal rapid transit system, which is essentially a driverless monorail with separate cars for every passenger. He also developed a business plan for a company<br>
    that would use software to build a music synthesizer during this time.
  </p>
  <h3>Sergey Birn :</h3>
<p>
  Brin attended elementary school at Paint Branch Montessori School in Adelphi, Maryland, but he received further education at home; his father, a professor in the department of<br>
  mathematics at the University of Maryland, encouraged him to learn mathematics and his family helped him retain his Russian-language skills. He attended Eleanor Roosevelt High<br>
  School, Greenbelt, Maryland. In September 1990, Brin enrolled in the University of Maryland, where he received his Bachelor of Science from the Department of Computer Science<br>
  in 1993 with honors in computer science and mathematics at the age of 19. In 1993, he interned at Wolfram Research, the developers of Mathematica.<br>
  Brin began his graduate study in computer science at Stanford University on a graduate fellowship from the National Science Foundation. As of 2008,<br>
  he was on leave from his PhD studies at Stanford.
</p>
<h1>PhD studies and research (Larry Page)</h1><hr>
<p>
  After enrolling in a computer science PhD program at Stanford University, Page was in search of a dissertation theme and considered exploring the mathematical properties of the<br>
  World Wide Web, understanding its link structure as a huge graph. His supervisor, Terry Winograd, encouraged him to pursue the idea, and Page recalled in 2008 that it was the best<br>
  advice he had ever received. He also considered doing research on telepresence and self-driving cars during this time.<br>
  Page focused on the problem of finding out which web pages linked to a given page, considering the number and nature of such backlinks as valuable information for that page.<br>
  The role of citations in academic publishing would also become pertinent for the research. Sergey Brin, a fellow Stanford PhD student, would soon join Page's research project,<br>
  nicknamed "BackRub." Together, the pair authored a research paper titled "The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine" , which became one of the most<br>
  downloaded scientific documents in the history of the Internet at the time.<br>
  John Battelle, co-founder of Wired magazine, wrote that Page had reasoned that the:<br><br>
  ... entire Web was loosely based on the premise of citation—after all, what is a link but a citation? If he could devise a method to count and qualify each backlink on the<br>
  Web, as Page puts it "the Web would become a more valuable place."<br><br>
  Battelle further described how Page and Brin began working together on the project:<br><br>
  At the time Page conceived of BackRub, the Web comprised an estimated 10 million documents, with an untold number of links between them. The computing resources<br>
  required to crawl such a beast were well beyond the usual bounds of a student project. Unaware of exactly what he was getting into, Page began building out his crawler.<br>
  The idea's complexity and scale lured Brin to the job. A polymath who had jumped from project to project without settling on a thesis topic, he found the premise behind<br>
  BackRub fascinating. "I talked to lots of research groups" around the school, Brin recalls, "and this was the most exciting project, both because it tackled the Web,<br>
  which represents human knowledge, and because I liked Larry."

<h1>Search engine development (PageRank)</h1><hr>

<p>
  <i><b>PageRank (PR)</b></i> is an algorithm used by Google Search to rank web pages in their search engine results. PageRank is a<br>
  way of measuring the importance of website pages. According to Google:<br><br>
  PageRank works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how<br>
  important the website is. The underlying assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites.<br><br>
  Currently, PageRank is not the only algorithm used by Google to order search results, but it is the first algorithm that was<br>
  used by the company, and it is the best known. As of September 24, 2019, PageRank and all associated patents are expired.
</p>
<h2>Description :</h2>
<center>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/PageRank-hi-res.png/220px-PageRank-hi-res.png" alt=" basic principle of PageRank">
</center>
<p>
  <i><b>PageRank</b></i> is a link analysis algorithm and it assigns a numerical weighting to each element of a hyperlinked set of documents, such as the<br>
  World Wide Web, with the purpose of "measuring" its relative importance within the set. The algorithm may be applied to any collection o<br>
  entities with reciprocal quotations and references. The numerical weight that it assigns to any given element E is referred to as the PageRank of E and denoted by <i><b>PR(E)</b></i>.<br><br>
  A PageRank results from a mathematical algorithm based on the webgraph, created by all World Wide Web pages as nodes and hyperlinks as edges,<br>
  taking into consideration authority hubs such as cnn.com or mayoclinic.org. The rank value indicates an importance of a particular page. <br>
  A hyperlink to a page counts as a vote of support. The PageRank of a page is defined recursively and depends on the number and<br>
  PageRank metric of all pages that link to it ("incoming links"). A page that is linked to by many pages with high PageRank receives a high rank itself.<br><br>
  Numerous academic papers concerning PageRank have been published since Page and Brin's original paper. In practice, the PageRank<br>
  concept may be vulnerable to manipulation. Research has been conducted into identifying falsely influenced PageRank rankings. The goal is<br>
  to find an effective means of ignoring links from documents with falsely influenced PageRank.<br><br>
  Other link-based ranking algorithms for Web pages include the HITS algorithm invented by Jon Kleinberg (used by Teoma and now Ask.com), the IBM CLEVER project, the TrustRank<br>
  algorithm and the Hummingbird algorithm.
</p>
<h2>Algorithm :</h2>
<p>
  The PageRank algorithm outputs a probability distribution used to represent the likelihood that a person randomly clicking on links will arrive at any particular page. PageRank can be<br>
  calculated for collections of documents of any size. It is assumed in several research papers that the distribution is evenly divided among all documents in the collection at thebeginning of <br>
  the computational process. The PageRank computations require several passes, called "iterations", through the collection to adjust approximate PageRank values to more closely reflect the theoretical true value.

<p>
  <i><b>Alphabet Inc.</b></i> is an American multinational conglomerate headquartered in Mountain View, California. It was created through a<br>
  restructuring of Google on October 2, 2015, and became the parent company of Google and several former Google<br>
  subsidiaries. The two co-founders of Google remained as controlling shareholders, board members, and employees at Alphabet<br>
  Alphabet is the world's fourth-largest technology company by revenue and one of the world's most valuable companies.<br><br>
  The establishment of Alphabet Inc. was prompted by a desire to make the core Google business "cleaner and more accountable" while<br>
  allowing greater autonomy to group companies that operate in businesses other than Internet services. Founders Larry Page and<br>
  Sergey Brin announced their resignation from their executive posts in December 2019, with the CEO role to be filled by Sundar Pichai,<br>
  also the CEO of Google. Page and Brin remain co-founders, employees, board members, and controlling shareholders of Alphabet Inc.

<p>
  <i><b>Google LLC</b></i> is an American multinational technology company that specializes in Internet-related services and products, which include<br>
  online advertising technologies, a search engine, cloud computing, software, and hardware. It is considered one of the five Big Tech<br>
  companies along with Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft.<br><br>
  Google was founded in September 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University in<br>
  California. Together they own about 14% of its shares and control 56% of the stockholder voting power through super-voting stock.<br>
  Google was incorporated in California on September 4, 1998. Google was then reincorporated in Delaware on October 22, 2002.<br>
  In July 2003, Google moved to its headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the Googleplex. The company became a public<br>
  company via an initial public offering (IPO) on August 19, 2004. In October 2015, Google reorganized as a subsidiary of a conglomerate<br>
  called Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet's largest subsidiary and is a holding company for Alphabet's Internet interests. Sundar Pichai<br>
  was appointed CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet. In 2021, the Alphabet Workers Union was<br>
  founded, mainly composed of Google employees.<br><br>
  The company's rapid growth since incorporation has included products, acquisitions, and partnerships beyond Google's core search<br>
  engine, (Google Search). It offers services designed for work and productivity (Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides), email<br>
  (Gmail), scheduling and time management (Google Calendar), cloud storage (Google Drive), instant messaging and video chat (Google<br>
  Duo, Hangouts, Google Chat, and Google Meet), language translation (Google Translate), mapping and navigation (Google Maps,<br>
  Waze, Google Earth, and Street View), podcast hosting (Google Podcasts), video sharing (YouTube), blog publishing (Blogger), note-taking<br>
  (Google Keep and Jamboard), and photo organizing and editing (Google Photos). The company leads the development of the<br>
  Android mobile operating system, the Google Chrome web browser, and Chrome OS, a lightweight operating system based on the Chrome browser.<br>
  Google has moved increasingly into hardware; from 2010 to 2015, it partnered with major electronics manufacturers<br>
  in the production of its Google Nexus devices, and it released multiple hardware products in October 2016, including the Google Pixel<br>
  line of smartphones, Google Home smart speaker, Google Wifi mesh wireless router, and Google Daydream virtual reality headset.<br>
  Google has also experimented with becoming an Internet carrier (Google Fiber, Google Fi, and Google Station).<br><br>
  Google.com is the most visited website worldwide. Several other Google-owned websites also are on the list of most popular websites, including YouTube and Blogger.<br><br>
  On the list of most valuable brands, Google is ranked second by Forbes and fourth by Interbrand. It has received significant<br>
  criticism involving issues such as privacy concerns, tax avoidance, antitrust, censorship, and search neutrality.

  <i><b>Android</b></i> is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software, designed<br>
  primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Android is developed by a consortium of developers known<br>
  as the Open Handset Alliance and commercially sponsored by Google. It was unveiled in November 2007, with the first commercial<br>
  Android device, the HTC Dream, being launched in September 2008.<br><br>
  It is free and open-source software; its source code is known as Android Open Source Project (AOSP), which is primarily licensed<br>
  under the Apache License. However most Android devices ship with additional proprietary software pre-installed, most notably<br>
  Google Mobile Services (GMS) which includes core apps such as Google Chrome, the digital distribution platform Google Play and<br>
  associated Google Play Services development platform. About 70 percent of Android smartphones run Google's ecosystem;<br>
  competing Android ecosystems and forks include Fire OS (developed by Amazon) or LineageOS. However the "Android" name and<br>
  logo are trademarks of Google which impose standards to restrict "uncertified" devices outside their ecosystem to use Android branding.<br><br>
  The source code has been used to develop variants of Android on a range of other electronics, such as game consoles, digital<br>
  cameras, portable media players, PCs and others, each with a specialized user interface. Some well known derivatives include Android<br>
  TV for televisions and Wear OS for wearables, both developed by Google. Software packages on Android, which use the APK format,<br>
  are generally distributed through proprietary application stores like Google Play Store, Samsung Galaxy Store, Huawei AppGallery,<br>
  Cafe Bazaar, and GetJar, or open source platforms like Aptoide or F-Droid.<br><br>
  Android has been the best-selling OS worldwide on smartphones since 2011 and on tablets since 2013. As of May 2017, it has over two<br>
  billion monthly active users, the largest installed base of any operating system, and as of January 2021, the Google Play Store features<br>
  over 3 million apps. The current stable version is Android 11, released on September 8, 2020.

<p>
  As of March 2021, Android 10 is the most popular Android version, and Android 9.0 Pie second-most popular, on both phones and on tablets.<br>
  The three most recent Android versions are most popular on smartphones but not in that order, with Android 10 usage at 41%, Android 9.0 Pie at 19%,<br>
  and the most recent version, Android 11, at 10.39%, giving Android 9 and 10 together well over half the share. (Android 11 is fourth most popular at 8.6%).<br>
  Usage of Oreo 8.1 and newer, i.e. supported versions, is at 79%; the rest of users are not supported with security updates. <br>
  In virtually all countries Android 8.1 Oreo or later is used and most commonly Android 10.<br><br>
  On tablets, Android 10 is also the most popular version at 20% and Android 9.0 Pie thereafter at 14% (45% of Android tablets use Oreo 8.1 or newer,<br>
  meaning the rest use unsupported Android versions). Android 10 has grown its share over 10-fold in 8 weeks. The usage share of Android on<br>
  tablets varies a lot by country; still, Android 9.0 Pie is the single version with the greatest usage share in the United States at 28%, while Android 10<br>
  is most widespread in e.g. India, Russia, Canada, Australia, and some European countries, and Oreo 8.1 in China.

  <i><b>YouTube</b></i> is an online video sharing and social media platform owned by Google. Around the world, its users watch more than one<br>
  billion hours of YouTube videos each day. YouTube creators, popularly referred to as YouTubers, upload over one hundred hours of<br>
  content per minute. In 2005, YouTube.com was launched by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim.<br><br>
  Over the years, YouTube has expanded beyond the website into mobile apps, network television, and to permitting other services like<br>
  Discord and Nintendo to access YouTube. The range of videos on YouTube is seemingly infinite; users can find music videos, video<br>
  clips, short and documentary films, audio recordings, corporate sponsored movie trailers, live streams, video blogs, as well as conten<br>
  from popular YouTubers. Most content today is still generated by individuals, including collaborations between YouTubers and<br>
  from popular YouTubers. Most content today is still generated by individuals, including collaborations between YouTubers and<br>
  WarnerMedia have created and expanded their corporate YouTube channels to promote their content to a larger audience. YouTube<br>
  also acts as a social network by allowing users with a Google account to watch and upload their own videos, comment on videos, rate<br>
  and respond to comments, like or dislike videos, create playlists, and subscribe to other users and channels.<br><br>
  In 2006, when YouTube was a year old, it was bought by Google for US$1.65 billion. Under Google from 2006 onwards, YouTube<br>
  evolved from a small video streaming platform to an international juggernaut influencing popular culture, internet trends, and creating<br>
  multimillionaire celebrities. YouTube as a company has reported revenues of $19.8 billion in 2020. Globally, after Google.com,<br>
  YouTube is the most visited website, with over one billion monthly users. Google's ownership of YouTube has also changed its<br>
  business model; it no longer generates revenue from advertisements alone. YouTube now offers paid content such as movies and<br>
  exclusive content. YouTube itself and approved creators participate in Google's AdSense program, which generates more revenue for both parties.<br><br>
  YouTube's expansion also led it to become one of the landmarks of the modern internet[11] and an integral part of daily life for many<br>
  users. With billions of hours of content and thousands of niche groups, YouTube has also had a great social impact. As YouTube has<br>
  grown and evolved, it has become involved in many controversies that have made headline news. Such issues include: YouTube's self-<br>
  censorship, alleged corporate favoritism, users spreading conspiracy theories, and issues regarding child safety and wellbeing.

<p>
  <i><b>Google Nexus</b></i> is a discontinued line of consumer electronic devices that runs the Android operating system. Google managed the<br>
  design, development, marketing, and support of these devices, but some development and all manufacturing were carried out by<br>
  partnering with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). The line also included tablets and streaming media players, though neither<br>
  type of device are currently available. The most recent tablet was the Nexus 9 (made with HTC), and the most recent streaming media<br>
  player the Nexus Player (made with Asus).<br><br>
  Devices in the Nexus line were considered Google's flagship Android products. They contained little to no manufacturer or wireless<br>
  carrier modifications to Android (such as custom user interfaces), although devices sold through carriers may be SIM locked and had<br>
  some extra branding. The Verizon Galaxy Nexus featured a Verizon logo on the back and received software updates at a slower pace<br>
  than the unlocked variant, though it featured different hardware to accommodate Verizon's CDMA network. All Nexus devices featured<br>
  an unlockable bootloader to allow further development and end-user modification.[5] Nexus devices are often among the first Android<br>
  devices to receive updates to the operating system.<br><br>
  With the expansion of the Google Pixel product line in late 2016, Google stated that they "don't want to close a door completely, but there is no plan right now<br>
  to do more Nexus devices." In 2017, Google partnered with HMD Global in making new Nokia phones, which have been considered by some as a revival of Nexus.<br>

<h2>Google Pixel 6, Pixel 6 Pro: What we know about the specs so far</h2>
<p>
  Over the last week, we’ve seen renders of the Pixel 6 and the Pixel 6 Pro doing the rounds of the<br>
  internet. Shared by two different sources, Jon Prosser and OnLeaks in collaboration with 91Mobile)<br>
  both the sets of render are pretty much identical and show off the upcoming Pixel 6 and the Pixel 6 Pro.<br>
  Going by the renders we know some details about devices, including the fact that the Pixel 6 is<br>
  going to come with dual cameras on the back with the Pixel 6 Pro will have three.<br>
