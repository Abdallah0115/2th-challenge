    <p>Jeffrey Preston Bezos (/?be?zo?s/ BAY-zohss;[3] né Jorgensen; born January 12, 1964)[4] is an American business magnate, media proprietor, and investor. Bezos is the founder and CEO[a] of the multi-national technology company Amazon. With a net worth of more than $200 billion as of April 2021, he is the richest person in the world according to both Forbes and Bloomberg's Billionaires Index.[1]
    
        Born in Albuquerque and raised in Houston and later Miami, Bezos graduated from Princeton University in 1986. He holds a degree in electrical engineering and computer science. He worked on Wall Street in a variety of related fields from 1986 to early 1994. Bezos founded Amazon in late 1994, on a cross-country road trip from New York City to Seattle. The company began as an online bookstore and has since expanded to a wide variety of other e-commerce products and services, including video and audio streaming, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. It is currently the world's largest online sales company, the largest Internet company by revenue, and the world's largest provider of virtual assistants[6] and cloud infrastructure services through its Amazon Web Services branch.
        
        Bezos founded the aerospace manufacturer and sub-orbital spaceflight services company Blue Origin in 2000. Blue Origin's New Shepard vehicle reached space in 2015, and afterwards successfully landed back on Earth. The company has upcoming plans to begin commercial suborbital human spaceflight.[7] He also purchased the major American newspaper The Washington Post in 2013 for $250 million, and manages many other investments through his Bezos Expeditions venture capital firm.
        
        The first centibillionaire on the Forbes wealth index,[8] Bezos was named the "richest man in modern history" after his net worth increased to $150 billion in July 2018.[9] In August 2020, according to Forbes, he had a net worth exceeding $200 billion.[10] In 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, Bezos's wealth grew by approximately $24 billion.[11]
        
        On February 2, 2021, Bezos announced that he would step down as the CEO of Amazon sometime in the third quarter of 2021, and transition into the role of executive chairman. He is due to be replaced as CEO by Andy Jassy, the chief of Amazon's cloud computing division.</p>

        Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on January 12, 1964, the son of Jacklyn (née Gise) and Theodore J?rgensen.[14] His biological great-grandfather John J?rgensen, born 8 January 1872 on the small island of Sams?, then in Holb?k County, Zealand, today a municipality in the Central Denmark Region, Denmark, immigrated around 1900 to Chicago, where he had a son, Theodore "Ted" John Jorgensen (b. 1917) with his wife, Ida Minnie Jorgensen, who was also born in Denmark. This son was the father of Ted Jorgensen (b. 1944), Jeff Bezo's biological father.[15][better source needed][16] At the time of his birth, his mother was a 17-year-old high school student and his father was 19.[17] After completing high school despite challenging conditions, Jacklyn attended night school while bringing baby Jeff along.[18] After his parents divorced, his mother married Cuban immigrant Miguel "Mike" Bezos in April 1968.[19] Shortly after the wedding, Mike adopted four-year-old Jorgensen, whose surname was then changed to Bezos.[20] The family moved to Houston, Texas, where Mike worked as an engineer for Exxon after he received a degree from the University of New Mexico.[21] Bezos attended River Oaks Elementary School in Houston from fourth to sixth grade.[22] Bezos's maternal grandfather was Lawrence Preston Gise, a regional director of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) in Albuquerque.[23] Gise retired early to his family's ranch near Cotulla, Texas, where Bezos would spend many summers in his youth.[24] Bezos would later purchase this ranch and expand it from 25,000 acres (10,117 ha) to 300,000 acres (121,406 ha).[25][26] His maternal grandmother was Mattie Louise Gise (née Strait), through whom he is a cousin of country singer George Strait.[27]

        Bezos displayed scientific interests and technological proficiency, and once rigged an electric alarm to keep his younger siblings out of his room.[28][29] The family moved to Miami, Florida, where Bezos attended Miami Palmetto High School.[30][31] While Bezos was in high school, he worked at McDonald's as a short-order line cook during the breakfast shift.[32] He attended the Student Science Training Program at the University of Florida. He was high school valedictorian, a National Merit Scholar,[33][34] and a Silver Knight Award winner in 1982.[33] In his graduation speech, Bezos told the audience he dreamed of the day when mankind would colonize space. A local newspaper quoted his intention "to get all people off the earth and see it turned into a huge national park".[35] In 1986, he graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University with a 4.2 GPA and a Bachelor of Science in Engineering degree (B.S.E.) in electrical engineering and computer science; he was also a member of Phi Beta Kappa.[36][37] While at Princeton, Bezos was a member of the Quadrangle Club, one of Princeton's 11 eating clubs.[38] In addition, he was elected to Tau Beta Pi and was the president of the Princeton chapter of the Students for the Exploration and Development of Space (SEDS).[39][40]

    <p>After Bezos graduated from college in 1986, he was offered jobs at Intel, Bell Labs, and Andersen Consulting, among others.[41] He first worked at Fitel, a fintech telecommunications start-up, where he was tasked with building a network for international trade.[42] Bezos was promoted to head of development and director of customer service thereafter. He transitioned into the banking industry when he became a product manager at Bankers Trust. He worked there from 1988 to 1990. He then joined D. E. Shaw & Co, a newly founded hedge fund with a strong emphasis on mathematical modelling in 1990 and worked there until 1994. Bezos became D. E. Shaw's fourth senior vice-president at age 30.[43][41]</p>

    <p>In late 1993, Bezos decided to establish an online bookstore.[44] He left his job at D. E. Shaw and founded Amazon in his garage on July 5, 1994, after writing its business plan on a cross-country drive from New York City to Seattle.[45][46] Prior to settling on Seattle, Bezos had investigated setting up his company at an Indian reservation near San Francisco in order to avoid paying taxes.[47] Bezos initially named his new company Cadabra but later changed the name to Amazon after the Amazon River in South America, in part because the name begins with the letter A, which is at the beginning of the alphabet.[48] He accepted an estimated $300,000 from his parents and invested in Amazon.[46] He warned many early investors that there was a 70% chance that Amazon would fail or go bankrupt.[49] Although Amazon was originally an online bookstore, Bezos had always planned to expand to other products.[43][48] Three years after Bezos founded Amazon, he took it public with an initial public offering (IPO).[50] In response to critical reports from Fortune and Barron's, Bezos maintained that the growth of the Internet would overtake competition from larger book retailers such as Borders and Barnes & Noble.[48]
    
        In 1998, Bezos diversified into the online sale of music and video, and by the end of the year he had expanded the company's products to include a variety of other consumer goods.[48] Bezos used the $54 million raised during the company's 1997 equity offering to finance aggressive acquisition of smaller competitors.[48] In 2000, Bezos borrowed $2 billion from banks, as its cash balances dipped to only $350 million.[51] In 2002, Bezos led Amazon to launch Amazon Web Services, which compiled data from weather channels and website traffic.[48] In late 2002, rapid spending from Amazon caused it financial distress when revenues stagnated.[52] After the company nearly went bankrupt, he closed distribution centers and laid off 14% of the Amazon workforce.[51] In 2003, Amazon rebounded from financial instability and turned a profit of $400 million.[53][failed verification] In November 2007, Bezos launched the Amazon Kindle.[54] According to a 2008 Time profile, Bezos wished to create a device that allowed a "flow state" in reading similar to the experience of video games.[55] In 2013, Bezos secured a $600-million contract with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) on behalf of Amazon Web Services.[56] In October of that year, Amazon was recognized as the largest online shopping retailer in the world.[57]</p>

        <center><span>Bezos in 2010</span></center>
        <p>In May 2016, Bezos sold slightly more than one million shares of his holdings in the company for $671 million, the largest sum he had ever raised from selling some of his Amazon stock.[58] On August 4, 2016, Bezos sold another million of his shares for $756.7 million.[59] A year later, Bezos took on 130,000 new employees when he ramped up hiring at company distribution centers.[60] By January 19, 2018, his Amazon stock holdings had appreciated to slightly over $109 billion; months later he began to sell stock to raise cash for other enterprises, in particular, Blue Origin.[61] On January 29, 2018, he was featured in Amazon's Super Bowl commercial.[62] On February 1, 2018, Amazon reported its highest ever profit with quarterly earnings of $2 billion.[63] Due to the growth of Alibaba in China, Bezos has often expressed interest in expanding Amazon into India.[64] On July 27, 2017, Bezos momentarily became the world's wealthiest person over Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates when his estimated net worth increased to just over $90 billion. His wealth surpassed $100 billion for the first time on November 24, 2017, and he was formally designated the wealthiest person in the world by Forbes on March 6, 2018, with a net worth of $112 billion.[65]</p>
