This article is about the co-founder of Microsoft. For other people of the same name, see Bill Gates (disambiguation).  
William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is an American business magnate, software developer, investor, author,
and philanthropist. He is the co-founder of Microsoft Corporation. During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the
positions of chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), president and chief software architect, while also being the largest 
individual shareholder until May 2014. He is considered one of the best known entrepreneurs of the microcomputer 
revolution of the 1970s and 1980s.
Gates was born and raised in Seattle, Washington. In 1975, he co-founded Microsoft with childhood friend Paul Allen in 
Albuquerque, New Mexico. It became the world's largest personal computer software company. Gates led the 
company as chairman and CEO until stepping down as CEO in January 2000, succeeded by Steve Ballmer, but he 
remained chairman of the board of directors and became chief software architect. During the late 1990s, he was 
criticized for his business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive. This opinion has been upheld by 
numerous court rulings. In June 2008, Gates transitioned to a part-time role at Microsoft and full-time work at the Bill & 
Melinda Gates Foundation, the private charitable foundation he and his wife, Melinda Gates, established in 2000. He 
stepped down as chairman of the board of Microsoft in February 2014 and assumed a new post as technology adviser to 
support the newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella. In March 2020, Gates left his board positions at Microsoft and 
Berkshire Hathaway to focus on his philanthropic efforts including climate change, global health and development, and 
education.
Since 1987, Bill Gates has been included in the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest people. From 1995 to 2017, he
held the Forbes title of the richest person in the world every year except from 2010 to 2013. In October 2017, he was
surpassed by Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, who had an estimated net worth of US$90.6 billion compared to
Gates's net worth of US$89.9 billion at the time. As of May 2021, Gates had an estimated net worth of US$144 billion,
making him the fourth-richest person in the world.
Later in his career and since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft in 2008, Gates has pursued many business and
philanthropic endeavors. He is the founder and chairman of several companies, including BEN, Cascade Investment,
bgC3, and TerraPower. He has given sizable amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research
programs through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, reported to be the world's largest private charity. Through the
foundation, he led an early 21st century vaccination campaign which significantly contributed to the eradication of the wild
poliovirus in Africa. In 2010, Gates and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge, whereby they and other
billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy.<hr>

<p>
  Bill Gates was born in Seattle, Washington, on October 28, 1955.He is the son of William H. Gates Sr.(1925–2020) and
  Mary Maxwell Gates (1929–1994).His ancestryincludes English, German, and Irish/Scots-Irish.His father was 
  a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on the board of directors for First Interstate BancSystem and the United Way of 
  America. Gates's maternal grandfather was J. W. Maxwell, a national bank president. Gates has an older sister Kristi 
  (Kristianne) and a younger sister Libby. He is the fourthof his name in his family but is known as William Gates III or 
  "Trey" (i.e., three) because his father had the "II" suffix.The family lived in the Sand Point area of Seattle in 
  a home that was damaged by a rare tornado when Gates was seven years old.Early in his life, Gates observed that his 
  parents wanted him to pursue a law career.When he was young, his family regularly attended a church of the 
  Congregational Christian Churches, a Protestant Reformed denomination. Gates was small for his age and was
  bullied as a child. The family encouraged competition; one visitor reported that "it didn't matter whether it was 
  hearts or pickleball or swimming to the dock; there was always a reward for winning and there was always a penalty for 
  losing".32At 13, he enrolled in the private Lakeside prep school. where he wrote his first software program.
  When he was in the eighth grade, the Mothers' Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy
  a Teletype Model 33 ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a General Electric (GE) computer for the students.[36]
  Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in BASIC, and he was excused from math classes to pursue his 
  interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine, an implementation of tic-tac-toe that allowed users to
  play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code 
  perfectly.After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, Gates and other students sought time on systems including 
  DEC PDP minicomputers. One of these systems was a PDP-10 belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC) which banned Gates, 
  Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and Gates's best friend and first business partner Kent Evans, for the summer after it caught them 
  exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.The four students formed the Lakeside Programmers
  Club to make money. At the end of the ban, they offered to find bugs in CCC's software in exchange for extra computer time.
  Rather than using the system remotely via Teletype, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied source code for various programs
  that ran on the system, including Fortran, Lisp, and machine language. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970 when
  the company went out of business.
  The following year, a Lakeside teacher enlisted Gates and Evans to automate the school's class-scheduling system, providing
  them computer time and royalties in return. The duo worked diligently in order to have the program ready for their senior year. 
  Towards the end of their junior year, Evans was killed in a mountain climbing accident, which Gates has described as one of the
  saddest days of his life. Gates then turned to Allen who helped him finish the system for Lakeside.
  At 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen called Traf-O-Data to make traffic counters based on the Intel 8008 processor.[39]
  In 1972, he served as a congressional page in the House of Representatives. He was a National Merit Scholar when he
  graduated from Lakeside School in 1973. He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT) and enrolled
  at Harvard College in the autumn of 1973. He chose a pre-law major but took mathematics and graduate level computer
  science courses. While at Harvard, he met fellow student Steve Ballmer. Gates left Harvard after two years while Ballmer
  stayed and graduated magna cum laude. Years later, Ballmer succeeded Gates as Microsoft's CEO and maintained that position
  from 2000 until his resignation in 2014.
  Gates devised an algorithm for pancake sorting as a solution to one of a series of unsolved problems presented in a
  combinatorics class by professor Harry Lewis. His solution held the record as the fastest version for over 30 years, and its
  successor is faster by only 2%. His solution was formalized and published in collaboration with Harvard computer
  scientist Christos Papadimitriou.
  Gates remained in contact with Paul Allen and joined him at Honeywell during the summer of 1974. In 1975, the MITS Altair
  8800 was released based on the Intel 8080 CPU, and Gates and Allen saw the opportunity to start their own computer software
  company. Gates dropped out of Harvard that same year. His parents were supportive of him after seeing how much he 
  wanted to start his own company. He explained his decision to leave Harvard: "if things hadn't worked out, I could always 
  go back to school. I was officially on leave."<hr>

<h2><u> History of Microsoft </u></h2>

<P>

Gates read the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics which demonstrated the Altair 8800, and he contacted Micro
Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) to inform them that he and others were working on a BASIC interpreter for the
platform.In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge
MITS's interest. MITS president Ed Roberts agreed to meet them for a demonstration, and over the course of a few weeks they
developed an Altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration was held at
MITS's offices in Albuquerque, New Mexico; it was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as  
Altair BASIC. MITS hired Allen, and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with him at MITS in November
1975. Allen named their partnership "Micro-Soft", a combination of "microcomputer" and "software", and their first office was in
Albuquerque. The first employee Gates and Allen hired was their high school collaborator Ric Weiland. They dropped the
hyphen within a year and officially registered the trade name "Microsoft" with the Secretary of the State of New Mexico on
November 26, 1976. Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies.
Microsoft's Altair BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists, but Gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked out and
was being widely copied and distributed. In February 1976, he wrote an Open Letter to Hobbyists in the MITS newsletter in
which he asserted that more than 90% of the users of Microsoft Altair BASIC had not paid Microsoft for it and the Altair "hobby
market" was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce, distribute, and maintain high-
quality software. This letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but Gates persisted in his belief that software 
developers should be able to demandpayment.
Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976, and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems.
The company.moved from Albuquerque to Bellevue, Washington on January 1, 1979.
Gates said he personally reviewed and often rewrote every line of code that the company produced in its first five years.
As the company grew, he transitioned into a manager role, then an executive.
DONKEY.BAS,is a computer game written in 1981 and included with early versions of the PC DOS operating system distributed with
the original IBM PC.
It is a driving game in which the player must avoid hitting donkeys. The game was written by Gates and Neil Konzen.

</p>

<h2><u> Windows </u></h2>

<p>

Microsoft and Gates launched their first retail version of Microsoft Windows on November 20, 1985 in an attempt to fend off 
competition from Apple's Macintosh GUI, which had bewitched consumers with its simplicity and ease of use.
In August of the following year, the company struck a deal with IBM to develop a separate operating system called OS/2.
Although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system, the partnership deteriorated due to mounting
creative differences.
The operating system grew out of DOS in an organic fashion over a decade, until with Windows 95 the DOS text screen
was relegated to the closet. Windows XP, released one year after Gates stepped down as Microsoft CEO, reportedly was the first
to not be based on DOS.Windows 8.1 was the last version of the OS released before Gates left the Chair of the firm to John W.Thompson 
on February 5, 2014. As of 2020, the latest release is known as Windows <hr>

    <h2><u> Regulation of the software industry </u></h2>

    In 1998, Gates rejected the need for regulation of the software industry in testimony before the United States Senate.
    <h2><u> Donald Trump Facebook ban </u></h2>
    On February 18, 2021, after Facebook and Twitter had banned Donald Trump from their platforms as a result of the 2020
    United States presidential election which led to the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol,
    Gates said a permanent ban of Trump "would be a shame" and would amount to an "extreme measure." He warned that
    such a move would cause "polarization" if users with different political views divide up among various social networks.
    "I don't think banning somebody who actually did get a fair number of votes (in the presidential election) – well less than
    a majority – but I don't think having him off forever would be that good."
   <h2><u> Patents for COVID-19 vaccines </u></h2>
   In April 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Gates was criticized for suggesting that pharmaceutical companies should hold
  onto patents for COVID-19 vaccines. The criticism came due to the possibility of this preventing poorer nations from obtaining
  adequate vaccines. Tara Van Ho of the University of Essex stated, "Gates speaks as if all the lives being lost in India are
  inevitable but eventually the West will help when in reality the US & UK are holding their feet on the neck of developing states
  by refusing to break [intellectual property rights] protections. It's disgusting."<hr>

<P>
In 1999, his wealth briefly surpassed US$101 billion. Since 2000, the nominal value of his Microsoft holdings 
has declined due to a fall in Microsoft's stock price after the dot-com bubble burst and the multi-billion
dollar donations he has made to his charitable foundations. In May 2006, Gates remarked that he wished that he
were not the richest man in the world because he disliked the attention it brought.[197] In March 2010,
Gates was the second wealthiest person after Carlos Slim, but regained the top position in 2013, according
to the Bloomberg Billionaires List.[198][199] Slim retook the position again in June 2014 (but then lost
the top position back to Gates). Between 2009 and 2014, his wealth doubled from US$40 billion to more than US$82 billion.
In October 2017, Gates was surpassed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos as the richest person in the world.
On November 15, 2019, he once again became the richest person in the world after a 48% increase in Microsoft shares,
surpassing Bezos.Gates told the BBC, "I've paid more tax than any individual ever, and gladly so ... I've paid over $6 billion
in taxes." He is a proponent of higher taxes, particularly for the rich.
Gates has held the top spot on the list of The World's Billionaires for 18 out of the past 23 years.
Gates has several investments outside Microsoft, which in 2006 paid him a salary of US$616,667 and US$350,000 bonus
totalling US$966,667. In 1989, he founded Corbis, a digital imaging company. In 2004, he became a director of Berkshire Hathaway,
the investment company headed by long-time friend Warren Buffett.
In 1987, Gates was listed as a billionaire in Forbes magazine's 400 Richest People in America issue, worth $1.25 billion
at the time, and was the world's youngest self-made billionaire.Since 1987, Gates has been included in the Forbes
The World's Billionaires list and was the wealthiest person from 1995 to 1996, 1998 to 2007, 2009, and held the spot
until 2018 before being overtaken by Jeff Bezos. Gates was number one on the Forbes 400 list from 1993 through to 2007,
